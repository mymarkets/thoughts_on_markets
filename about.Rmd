Welcome to the *Reproducible Finance with R* blog.

Financial applications were an early driving force behind the adoption of the R language, but as data science becomes increasingly critical to banks, hedge funds, investment managers, data providers, exchanges, etc., R is becoming even more important to Finance. We are excited and inspired by what the future holds in the brave new world of data-driven financial institutions.

We hope that *Reproducible Finance with R* will attract other voices from around the R Community. If you have something to say on a finance related topic, news, commentary, or an example of using R in finance that you would like to share with the R Community, please email your ideas to <jonathan.regenstein@rstudio.com>.

We welcome comments from all readers and encourage discussion. However, comments will not be moderated. Please be courteous and civil.
